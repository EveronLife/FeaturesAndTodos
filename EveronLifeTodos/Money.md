### **1. Banking and Cash Handling**

- **Implement Personal and Service Accounts**
    - Develop a banking system that includes personal accounts for each player and service accounts for organizations like the police and medical services.
    - Each account should have a unique ID.
- **Cash Handling**
    - Create a feature where players can carry a limited amount of cash on hand.
    - Implement a maximum limit to the cash that can be physically carried by a player.

### **2. Spending and Transactions**

- **NPC Transactions**
    - Develop a system for players to purchase items from NPCs, differentiating between types of sellers.
    - Some NPC transactions may require additional conditions like bribes or licenses (e.g., Rebel License).
- **Money Transfer System**
    - Allow players to send money to other accounts, including those of both online and offline players.
    - Take a small fee of all transactions as a money sink. Adjustable by server admins.
    - Ensure transactions are secure and logged within the game's banking system.

### **3. Passive Income and Investments**

- **Passive Income**
    - Set up a system where players receive a certain amount of money at regular intervals without needing to actively work, simulating a basic income or salary.
- **Investment Opportunities**
    - Implement an investment feature where players can invest their in-game money.
    - Offer specific locations where investments can be made.
    - Determine if the return on investments should be based on random fluctuations or mimic real-world financial markets.

### **4. Money Sinks**

- **Purchased Items**
    - Weapons, clothing etc can't be looted from bodies. This is an important money sink and a way to keep gear from piling up.
- **Progressive Fines**
    - Players with a lot of money will receive higher fines. This way they will remain impactful even to wealthy players.
    - The difference between the base fine price and the increased price will not be paid to the officer giving the fine, to delete the money from circulation.
- **Cosmetics**
    - Through some system, players should be able to spend large sums of money on cosmetic unlocks (clothing, vehicle skins etc.).
