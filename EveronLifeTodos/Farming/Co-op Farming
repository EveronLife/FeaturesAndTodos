# Coop Farming
# Adaptation of Combined Farming:

### **1. Resource Gathering**

- **Grown, Hunted, Fished**
    - Grown vegetables from seed purchased at markets, or found and harvested.
    - Ensure each material can be gathered independently, requiring player interaction and possibly specific tools or skills.
    - Meats or fish hunted from NPC animals, or fishing in water with a pole system.

### **2. Sell to Player owned restaurant **

- **Restaurant, Limited access crafting**
    - Restaurants are locked only to players with key to the restaurant, which has special crafting tables to make specialized consumables by combinging harvested items.
      
         -Example:  
## Player Owned Restaurant  (limited access crafting)
## Player House (Stovetop/crafting)

{Recipe 1: burger
   {Lettuce(farming) +Meat(hunting)+bread
    }

{Recipe 2: fish_sandwich
 {Lettuce(farming)+Fish(fishing)+bread(wheat:farm)   	
  }

}

### **3.Restaurants can sell items to other players, or put up on player market**

- **Sales for End Products**
    - Develop options for players to sell Product C either to NPCs or through player-owned shops within the game.
    - Ensure the selling mechanism integrates seamlessly with the gameâ€™s economy, with balanced pricing and demand factors.
    - Restaurants will continuously need an inflow of harvested items from farmers to make consumables and restaurant owners can sell directly via RP, or Utilize stocking a vending machine placed throughout the map
