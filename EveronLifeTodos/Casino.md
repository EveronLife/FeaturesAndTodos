1. **Casino Games Implementation**
    - Select and implement various casino games that players can participate in. Options could include card games like poker or blackjack, slot machines, roulette, and others suited to your game's mechanics and theme.
    - Ensure the games are designed with fair randomness, possibly using trusted random number generation methods.
2. **Currency and Betting System**
    - Develop a betting system where players can wager in-game currency. This system should handle bets, payouts, and track player balances accurately.
    - Consider implementing a cash-in, cash-out system where players must exchange game currency for chips or a similar casino-specific currency.
3. **Prize Structure**
    - Set up a reward system for the casino that includes cash prizes, special vehicles, unique items, and exclusive vehicle skins.
    - Ensure that the prizes are enticing enough to draw player participation but balanced enough to not disrupt the game's economy.
4. **Winning Vehicles and Items**
    - Create unique vehicles and items that can only be won in the casino, adding exclusive content that enhances player engagement.
    - Include unique vehicle skins as rare prizes, possibly using a jackpot or high-stake game to make winning these skins challenging.
